# PURPOSE OF APPLICATION
The purpose of the coding quiz is to ask the user a series of question. The user has a total of 60 seconds to answer all 5 question. If they answer a question correctly, they are rewarded with a point, with 5 points being the maximum points a user can get. But if the user answers incorrectly, 10 seconds is deducted from the time. If the time reaches 0, the quiz ends irregardless if the user finishes or not. After the quiz ends, the user inputs their name (to local storage). Then they will be brought to the high score page where information from local storage appears. There is also a go home button (where they can choose if they want to retake the quiz), or a clear highscore button (where local storage is cleared).
